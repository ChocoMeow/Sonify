(ahh, yeah) \n\n(Verse 2) \nGold chains, midnight haze, (mm, midnight) \nYour perfume lingers in the maze. \nVelvet secrets, lips so bold, (ah-ha, dangerous) \nA touch too hot, a heart too cold. \n\n(Bridge) \nOh, don’t say my name, just let it flow, (shh, just feel it) \nWe dance like we got nowhere to go. \nFading echoes, burning bright, (mmm, yeah) \nLost in love, lost in night. \n\n(Chorus) \nMove slow, feel the fire, (ahh, don't stop) \nLet the rhythm take you higher. \nDrunk on you, no escape, (mmm, so high) \nA midnight mirage, I fade away. (yeah, fade away) \n\n(Outro) \nSlow burn, deep sigh, (ah-ha, ohh) \nHeat rising under neon lights... END",

Chorus Surah At-Takatsur, ngelingake kita, Aja gumunan marang nikmat donya. Pati mesti teka, tanggung jawab ana, Gunakake nikmat kanggo ridho Gusti. Verse 2 Saben langkahmu, saben ambekmu, Bakal diitung ing dino ketemu. Nikmat sing agung, aja dibuwang sia, Akhirat nyeluk, aja lali wayahe. Chorus Surah At-Takatsur, ngelingake kita, Aja gumunan marang nikmat donya. Pati mesti teka, tanggung jawab ana, Gunakake nikmat kanggo ridho Gusti. Bridge Mbesuk bakal ditakoni, Nikmat Gusti sing wis diwenehi. Wis ta syukuri, opo mung lali, Ngoyak donyo nganti ora ngreti? Chorus Surah At-Takatsur, ngelingake kita, Aja gumunan marang nikmat donya. Pati mesti teka, tanggung jawab ana, Gunakake nikmat kanggo ridho Gusti.
